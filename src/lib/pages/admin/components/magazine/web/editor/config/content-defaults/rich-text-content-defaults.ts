  content: `<p>When I first became a licensed aesthetician, I went straight to work at a medical spa. Retinol was everywhere, prescribed to anyone who asked for it. Many of those patients would end up in my treatment room.</p><p>Fresh out of aesthetics school, I still carried the weight of textbook teachings. I'd been a skincare devotee my entire life, devouring ingredient research and product studies, I thought I knew exactly how skin should be treated. But it didn't take long to realize that much of what I'd been taught conflicted with what I was seeing in real life.</p><p>Client after client arrived with the same issues after weeks of retinol use: dryness, dehydration, redness, irritation, heightened sensitivity and in some cases, an increase in hyperpigmentation (brown spots). My initial advice was to reduce usage to one or two nights a week, allowing skin time to adjust. But even then, the problems persisted. It wasn't until I had clients stop retinol completely that their skin truly improved.</p><p>The mainstream belief is that retinol is the gold standard in anti-aging because it speeds up cellular turnover. In my experience, it often does the opposite, accelerating visible aging by stripping the skin of its moisture. I always tell people, "There's no quicker way to look older than your age than to have dry skin".</p><p>Many people are disappointed to hear this, given retinol's growing reputation. But skincare is not a "one size fits all" science, and popularity doesn't guarantee truth. My advice for a youthful complexion? Keep skin consistently hydrated and moisturized, ideally with monthly professional treatments that include advance exfoliation, such as dermaplaning, to restore that luminous, healthy glow.</p><p>I'll never forget one man who swore retinol had transformed his skin. He'd been using it for three years, until I looked up his product and discovered it didn't contain a drop of retinol. He'd achieved great skin without it, proving my point entirely.</p><p>If you want to age beautifully, focus on a non-comedogenic skincare routine, morning and night, that includes cleansing, a targeted serum, moisturizer, and eye cream if needed. The true secret to timeless skin isn't in a bottle of retinol, it's in keeping the skin healthy.</p>`,
