    content: `<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">Melanie Marks never set out to build just another app. She set out to rewrite the rules of an entire industry.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">"I've been in beauty for over 15 years," she says. "And I've seen how the most talented professionals are often the ones struggling the most to be seen, booked, and valued for what they're worth."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">The problem wasn't the talent. The problem was the systems.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">Beauty professionals are being forced to navigate a patchwork of tools and platforms. Chasing likes on social media, fighting algorithms, booking systems, payment links, and e-commerce stores, all while making people look and feel their best. "The systems are broken," Marks says. "And if something's broken, you can either complain about it or build something better."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">So she started building.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">The first platform was small, too small. "I thought we could solve one pain point and let it grow from there," she recalls. "But I quickly learned this industry doesn't need a band-aid. It needs a full rebuild from the ground up. But the goal has never changed, help professionals build their business."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">Every setback was a pivot. Every roadblock, a blueprint for something stronger. Slowly, the idea grew from a simple MVP into a multi-layered platform. Designed to put professionals back in control, to give them not just tools, but opportunities.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">"I want beauty and wellness pros making six and seven figures, not just influencers," Marks says. "Because if influencers can do it, the people with the education, skills and credentials should be killing it too. Glamlink makes that possible.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">Now, Glamlink is a living ecosystem-a place where every feature drives back to a booking or a sale. Professionals can showcase their work, sell professional-grade products that deliver real results, educate clients, and soon, tap into AI-powered discovery and exclusive brand collaborations.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">"It's not just about booking a service," Marks explains. "It's about building a business, whether you're creating your own skincare line, expanding your education, or scaling what you've already built, Glamlink gives you a place to grow it and to dominate it."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">Her journey has been anything but easy. Long nights turned into early mornings, building a vision from scratch while raising her 15-year-old son on her own. Every hurdle tested her, but none broke her. Instead, each challenge sharpened her resolve to create something that could change not only her life, but the lives of countless beauty and wellness professionals. That grit and unshakable belief are woven into Glamlink-a platform born from perseverance, purpose, and a vision to empower every professionals potential.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 15pt;">Now, she's inviting the industry to step into what comes next. A platform built for beauty and wellness, by someone who has lived it, struggled through it, and refused to settle for anything less than transformation.</span></p>`,
